// The CameraModeArea component can be attached to an Entity to define a region of space where 
// the player's camera mode (1st-person or 3rd-person) is overridden.
//
// The Entity's Transform position determines the center-point of the region, while its size is 
// given as a vector in the `area` property below. The Transform rotation is applied, but the scale 
// is ignored.
//
// When players leave the region, their previous setting is restored.

// is actually a 3D volume.
